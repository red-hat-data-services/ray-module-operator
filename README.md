# ray-module-operator

Module operator for the Ray component in OpenDataHub. Manages the lifecycle of the
KubeRay operator (install, upgrade, status, removal) as part of the ODH modular architecture.

## Overview

This operator reconciles a `Ray` custom resource (`components.platform.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`)
and is deployed by the ODH platform operator when the Ray module is enabled.

**Epic:** [RHOAIENG-62503](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHOAIENG-62503)
**Feature:** [RHAISTRAT-1064](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/RHAISTRAT-1064)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Docker or Podman

### Build

```sh
make build
```

### Test

```sh
make test
```

### Lint

```sh
make lint
```

### Docker Build

```sh
make docker-build IMG=quay.io/opendatahub/odh-ray-module-operator:latest
```

### Operand manifests

The Ray module owns the KubeRay operand manifests. Platform installation
manifests contain only the module operator; the image carries the selected
KubeRay snapshot under `/opt/manifests/kuberay`.

Normal builds use the committed snapshots under `opt/manifests/{odh,rhoai}`.
Run `make update-manifests` in a connected environment to refresh them from
the pinned upstream KubeRay commits.
